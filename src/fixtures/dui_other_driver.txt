The other driver was drunk and got arrested for DUI. He was intoxicated and failed the breathalyzer test. I went to the ER that day and saw a specialist. The police report shows he was under the influence. My back pain is severe, about a 9 out of 10. I missed 6 days of work and need ongoing treatment.
