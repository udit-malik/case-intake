I was a passenger in an Uber when we got rear-ended. The driver was in driver mode and had just accepted a ride. The police came and filed a report. There was minor damage to the bumper. I got whiplash and went to urgent care the next day. The other driver admitted fault. I had to miss 2 days of work. My neck pain is about a 6 out of 10.
